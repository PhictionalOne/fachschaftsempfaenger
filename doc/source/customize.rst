How to customize
================

We are delighted that you are interested in running a customized version of our
Django app in your student union. Please first check out `our license
<https://github.com/fsi-tue/fachschaftsempfaenger/blob/master/LICENSE.txt>`_
whether this project fit your needs. If your have questions, feel free to
:ref:`contact us <contact>`.

Customize the submodules
------------------------

The subodules listed in :doc:`Submodules <submodules>` are all designed to fit
the needs of the student union of Computer Science in Tuebingen. Therefore, you
have to rewrite these submodules for your own needs. If you stay at the API
described in the :doc:`Submodules section of the documentation <submodules>`,
this should be sufficient for your own infoscreen.

Customize the design
--------------------

If your are not happy with the design or want to add your own style sheets you
can store them in the ``assets/`` directory. The ``index.html`` of the app can be
found in the ``fachschaftsempfaenger/templates/`` directory together with all the
other templates for this project.
